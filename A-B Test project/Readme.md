**Project Background**

**Background Description**

This dataset consists of simulated data that summarizes user webpage views and button clicks in an A/B test.

A/B testing refers to testing two or more versions of a webpage or advertisement to determine which version is more effective. In A/B testing, user data is analyzed to understand which version provides a better user experience.

The A/B testing process typically includes the following steps:

In this project, the main focus is on the data analysis and interpretation of results.

• **Set goals and hypotheses**：Determine the metrics to be tested and compared, such as conversion rates, click-through rates, etc. Also, establish the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for statistical inference after testing.

• **Split Sample**：Randomly divide the tested users or sample groups into A and B groups, ensuring consistency in feature distribution to reduce bias impact.

• **Develop a testing plan**：Specify the time range and sample size for the test, and set the required statistical metrics and significance level.

• **Implement**：Apply different variables to groups A and B during the test, such as different page designs, button colors, etc. Collect necessary data, such as conversion numbers, click counts, etc.

• **Data analysis**：Compare the test results of the two groups, calculate statistical indicators such as conversion rate differences, click-through rate differences, etc. Use appropriate statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing or confidence intervals, for significance testing.

• **Interpretation**：Based on the results of significance testing, determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. If the difference is significant, it indicates a significant difference in indicators between the two groups; if the difference is not significant, no conclusion can be drawn, and more data or a redesign of the test may be needed.

• **Summary and application**：Summarize the results of the A/B test, and based on the actual situation, decide whether to adopt the better option. If the test results contribute to improving metrics or achieving goals, the better variables can be applied to the actual production environment.
